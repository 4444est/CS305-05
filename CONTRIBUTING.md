## Reporting security flaws

If you find a flaw in our project that can hurt users or provide unauthorized access, please contact our maintainer privately, as follows.

Contact: @ mpa92@nau.edu

See [SECURITY.md]() for more information on security.

## Bug reporting

We encourage people to report bugs. Please read [How to Submit a Good Bug Report](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook/blob/master/bug_report.adoc) before submitting your report. The most important advice from there is: 1) do as thorough a search as you can to see whether the bug has already been reported, and 2) be as precise and complete as you can when reporting a new bug.

To report a bug:

1. Go to the appropriate project.

2. Click the Issues button on the left of the window.

3. Click the "New issue" button.

4. Fill out the Title and Description. You don't need to fill out the other fields. 

## Other Issues

The issue tracker is used for many issues besides bugs. Please read the [cs305 webpage](https://cs305module05.com/curecancer) Before suggesting an issue. please look over our milestones and issue boards to see whether your feature has already been listed.

After you create an issue, our team will assign a priority to the issue, ensure it is labeled properly, and perhaps request additional information from you.

## Roadmap

## Cloning, Branching, and Merging

Anyone contributing source code should clone the project (also known as *forking*) using Git commands. The term *fork* in GitLab differs from an older meaning of the word, which referred to people breaking away from a project and starting a new one. Here, *fork* just means that someone creates their own personal copy, and intends to push changes back to the project.

Git also allows multiple branches of a project. Here you can list your policy for creating a branch and for accepting code back into the main branch.

Submitting code to a project is called a *pull request*. A comprehensive [Gitlab document](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html) describes various robust workflows for handling pull requests. We recommend that you adopt one of those workflows.

Although most pull requests fix bugs or add features, a pull request can offer more specific contributions as well, such as a test for a bug or a feature.

### Style guide

### Pull request workflow

The [Introduction to GitLab Flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html) provides useful background. Please use the following workflow when submitting merge requests.

### Creating the material for a pull request

1. Fork our project into your personal namespace or group.

2. Create a feature branch in your fork. If possible, include the title of the issue or the issue number that the merge request corresponds to.

3. Write appropriate continuous integration tests.

4. Push the commit(s) to your working branch in your fork.
  - Squash commits into a small number of logically organized commits, keeping the commit history intact on shared branches.
  - Please try to have fewer than 15 commit messages per merge request.

### Testing

### The merge request

Submit a merge request (MR) to our projects default branch, following these criteria.

  - Refer to the issue that defines the bug you are fixing or the feature you are adding.
  - Include a test or tests.
  - Include updates to any relevant or affected documentation.
  - The merge request title should describe the change you wish to make.
  - The merge request description should give the reason for the change.
  - Use complete URLs to issues and other merge requests, milestones, etc.
  - Include the complete path when referring to files within this repository (no URL required).
  - Try to keep the amount of changes you make in a single merge request as small as possible.
  - Do not include emoji in commit messages.

Please follow Chris Beam's seven rules for writing a good commit messages:

- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
- Capitalize the subject line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
- Wrap the body at 72 characters.
- Use the body to explain what and why versus how.

For examples and additional explanation of these seven rules, please read [Chris Beam's blog post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

### Merge request acceptance criteria

Your merge request needs at least one approval from a maintainer on the project, but depending on your change you might need additional approvals. Merge requests that fix a regression are usually accepted quickly and usually only require a single approval, whereas a new feature may require approval from multiple maintainers and our project leads.

## Non-code contributions

## Code of conduct

Please read the [IEEE Code of Conduct](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/about/ieee_code_of_conduct.pdf), which governs projects on IEEE SA OPEN.
